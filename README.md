# bank - architectural experiment project

This project is an architectural experiment. It is a simple bank application that allows you to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and transfer money between accounts.

But the main goal of this project is to experiment with different architectural patterns and technologies. The project is uses clean architecture with golang standarts. Also this project uses some technologies like opentelemetry, grpc, prometheus, jaeger, kubernetes, etc, etc.

When we get exactly the structure we want, we will separate its bones and move it to [gopre's repository](https://github.com/9ssi7/gopre).
